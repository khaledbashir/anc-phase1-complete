<a id="mirror-mode"></a>
## 4. MIRROR MODE (Excel → PDF)

**URL:** `/projects/new` → "Upload Excel → PDF"

### What It Does
Takes an existing ANC Excel file and converts it into a branded PDF proposal. No re-typing. The system reads every cell.

### Step by Step
1. Click **New Project** → select **Upload Excel → PDF**
2. Upload `.xlsx` file (drag & drop or file picker)
3. System parses the Excel using `excelImportService.ts`:
   - Reads all sheets, detects headers, maps columns
   - Extracts: client name, project name, display specs, pricing, services
   - Handles multiple display sheets
4. Shows **branded PDF preview** in real-time
5. **Every field is editable** — click any value in the PDF to change it
6. Changes reflect immediately in the preview
7. **Export** → download PDF or share via client portal link

### The PDF Template
- **Font:** Work Sans (ANC brand)
- **Colors:** French Blue accents (#0A52EF)
- **Layout:** Supports both portrait and landscape
- **Sections:** Cover page, executive summary, display specifications, pricing table, terms
- **Template:** `ProposalLayout.tsx` with section components in `proposal-pdf/sections/`

### Key Files
- `services/proposal/server/excelImportService.ts` — Excel parsing engine
- `app/components/templates/proposal-pdf/ProposalLayout.tsx` — PDF template
- `app/components/templates/proposal-pdf/sections/` — Individual PDF sections

---

<a id="intelligence-mode"></a>
## 5. INTELLIGENCE MODE (Build from Scratch)

**URL:** `/estimator` → auto-creates project → `/estimator/[projectId]`

### What It Does
Split-screen workspace: left side is a typeform-style questionnaire, right side is a live Excel preview that updates as you answer questions.

### The Questionnaire Flow
Questions are defined in `questions.ts`. Three phases:

**Phase 1 — Project Info:**
- Client name, project name, location
- Document type (Budget / Proposal / LOI)
- Estimate depth (ROM / Detailed / Final)
- Indoor/outdoor, new install/replacement, union labor

**Phase 2 — Display Configuration (per display):**
- Display name (e.g., "Main Scoreboard")
- Display type preset (scoreboard, ribbon, fascia, marquee, end-zone, custom)
- Location type (wall, ceiling, floor, freestanding)
- Width × Height in feet
- Pixel pitch (1.5mm to 16mm)
- Product selection from catalog
- Install complexity (standard / complex / heavy)
- Service type (front/rear access)
- Steel scope (existing / secondary / full)
- Lift type (none / scissor / boom / crane)
- Power distance (near / medium / far)
- Data run (copper / fiber)
- Replacement? Existing structure? Spare parts?

**Phase 3 — Financial:**
- Margin tier (Budget: 15%/10%, Proposal: 30%/20%, LOI: 30%/20%)
- LED margin %, services margin %
- Bond rate, sales tax rate
- Target price (for Profit Shield reverse-calc)
- PM complexity

### The Calculation Engine (`EstimatorBridge.ts`)
For EACH display, `calculateDisplay()` computes:

| Line Item | How It's Calculated |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **LED Hardware** | Area (sqft) × cost per sqft (from rate card, varies by pixel pitch) |
| **Spare Parts** | 5% of hardware cost (if enabled) |
| **Structure/Steel** | Hardware × structure % (5% existing, 12% secondary, 20% full) |
| **Installation** | (Estimated weight × steel rate) + (area × LED install rate) |
| **Electrical** | Area × materials rate × power distance multiplier (1.0/1.3/1.8) |
| **Equipment Rental** | Lift type: scissor=$500, boom=$1,500, crane=$5,000 |
| **Data Cabling** | Fiber adds $3,000 flat; copper = $0 |
| **PM Cost** | Base fee × complexity multiplier (1×/2×/3×) |
| **Engineering** | Base fee × complexity multiplier |
| **Shipping** | Estimated weight × $0.50/lb |
| **Demolition** | $5,000 if replacement install |
| **Bundle Accessories** | Auto-calculated by Smart Assembly Bundler (see below) |
| **Union Multiplier** | 15% uplift on labor costs if union job |
| **Tiered Margins** | Separate LED margin vs services margin |
| **Bond** | Sell price × bond rate (default 1.5%) |
| **Sales Tax** | (Sell + bond) × tax rate (default 9.5%) |
| **Profit Shield** | If target price set, reverse-calculates required margin |

### Excel Preview Sheets (auto-generated)
The right panel shows a live Excel with these tabs:

1. **Executive Summary** — project overview, total cost/sell/margin
2. **Display Specifications** — per-display breakdown with all line items
3. **Margin Waterfall** — cost → margin → sell → bond → tax → final
4. **Cabinet Layout (Tetris)** — requested vs actual dimensions, cabinet grid, resolution, weight, power, heat load
5. **Bundle Accessories** — auto-suggested items with toggle on/off
6. **Custom Sheets** — user can add blank sheets and edit cells

### Export
- **Export .xlsx** button → downloads real Excel file with all sheets
- **Duplicate** → clones the entire estimate as a new project
- **To Proposal** → converts estimate into a full proposal (Mirror Mode)

<a id="estimator-tools"></a>
## 6. ESTIMATOR TOOLBAR — 10 POWER TOOLS

These are buttons in the EstimatorStudio toolbar. Each opens a panel overlay.

---

### 6.1 Auto-RFP Response (⚡ Auto-RFP)

**What:** AI reads an RFP document, extracts every LED screen requirement, matches each to a product from the catalog, and pre-fills the estimator with all displays.

**How it works:**
1. Upload an RFP PDF (or paste text)
2. PDF gets uploaded to AnythingLLM workspace
3. AI extraction prompt runs → returns structured JSON with every screen
4. Each screen gets matched to closest product in catalog (by pixel pitch + environment)
5. Review screen: shows each extracted screen with confidence badge, product match, fit score
6. Toggle individual screens on/off
7. Click "Apply" → all screens populate the estimator

**When to use:** When you receive a new RFP and need to extract all the display requirements.

**Benefit:** Turns a 2,500-page RFP into a populated estimate in 30 seconds.

---

### 6.2 3D Arena Preview (📦 3D)

**What:** Live 3D visualization of an arena showing LED display zones. Zones light up as you add displays to the estimate.

**When to use:** After adding displays. Show clients what the venue will look like.

**Benefit:** Visual selling tool — clients see their investment come to life.

---

### 6.3 Smart Assembly Bundle (📦 Bundle)

**What:** Auto-suggests hidden/forgotten accessories for each display. Estimators regularly forget items like video processors, receiving cards, spare modules, mounting brackets, cable kits — leaving $5K-$30K on the table per project.

**How it works:**
The bundler has 20+ rules in `bundleRules.ts`. For each display, it examines the configuration and suggests:

| Category | Example Items |
|----------|--------------|
| **Signal Processing** | Video processor ($12K), receiving cards ($85 each), sending card ($450), signal cables, fiber converters, backup processor |
| **Electrical** | PDU ($850), power cables ($8 each), surge protector ($350), UPS battery ($2,500 for scoreboards) |
| **Structural** | Mounting brackets ($25×2 per cabinet), rigging hardware ($3,500 for center-hung), weatherproof enclosure (outdoor) |
| **Accessories** | Spare receiving cards (2%), spare power supplies (2%), calibration probe ($800), CMS license ($2,400/yr) |
| **Services** | Commissioning ($2/sqft), demo/disposal ($3,500 if replacement), operator training ($1,500), as-built docs ($2,000) |

**User control:** Each item has a checkbox. Toggle items on/off. Excluded items are saved per display in `excludedBundleItems`.

**The bundle cost is included in the total estimate automatically.**

---

### 6.4 Price-to-Spec Reverse Engineer (🔍 Budget)

**What:** Enter a target budget and display size. The system searches the entire product catalog and shows which LED products fit within that budget, ranked by fit score.

**How it works:**
1. Enter: budget ($), width (ft), height (ft), indoor/outdoor
2. System queries all active products matching environment
3. For each product: calculates cabinet layout, hardware cost, estimated services, margin, bond, tax
4. Filters to products under budget
5. Ranks by fit score (area match × dimension match)
6. Shows top 10 options with: product name, pixel pitch, brightness, cabinet layout, estimated total, headroom, % of budget

**When to use:** Client says "I have $200K for a scoreboard" — instantly see what's possible.

**Benefit:** Answers "what can I get for $X?" in seconds instead of manual trial-and-error.

---

### 6.5 Vendor Spec Drop Zone (📦 Vendor)

**What:** Drop a manufacturer's PDF spec sheet and the system extracts cabinet dimensions, weight, power, pixel pitch, and other specs automatically.

**When to use:** When you receive a new product spec sheet from LG, Yaham, Absen, etc.

**Benefit:** Eliminates manual data entry from spec sheets — seconds instead of minutes.

---

### 6.6 Vendor RFQ Generator (📤 RFQ)

**What:** Auto-generates a professional Request for Quote email to LED manufacturers with your display specs, quantities, and ANC standard terms.

**How it works:**
1. Click RFQ after finalizing display specs
2. System builds email with: display dimensions, pixel pitch, quantity, environment, delivery requirements
3. Copy email or send directly

**When to use:** After finalizing specs, generate one RFQ per manufacturer.

**Benefit:** Professional RFQ in 10 seconds instead of writing emails from scratch.

---

### 6.7 Liability Hunter / SOW Scanner (🛡️ Risk)

**What:** Upload a SOW, RFP, or contract. The system scans it against a **20-point checklist** of required clauses:

| # | Check | What It Looks For |
|---|-------|------------------|
| 1 | Payment Terms | Net-30/60/90, milestone payments |
| 2 | Liability Cap | Maximum liability clause |
| 3 | Indemnification | Who indemnifies whom |
| 4 | Change Order Process | How scope changes are handled |
| 5 | Force Majeure | Acts of God, pandemic, supply chain |
| 6 | Warranty Terms | Duration, coverage, exclusions |
| 7 | Liquidated Damages | Penalties for late delivery |
| 8 | Insurance Requirements | GL, Workers Comp, Umbrella |
| 9 | Termination Clause | How either party can exit |
| 10 | IP Ownership | Who owns the work product |
| 11-20 | + 10 more | Dispute resolution, prevailing wage, bonding, retention, etc. |

**Output:** Risk score per category, overall risk level, specific clause recommendations.

**When to use:** Before signing ANY contract or SOW.

**Benefit:** Catches liability gaps that could cost $50K+ in unprotected exposure.

---

### 6.8 Revision Radar / Delta Scanner (🔀 Delta)

**What:** Upload an original and revised cost analysis Excel. The system diffs them section-by-section, highlights every change, and shows the dollar impact.

**When to use:** When a client sends an addendum or revised scope.

**Benefit:** Spot hidden cost changes in seconds instead of line-by-line comparison.

---

### 6.9 Visual Cut-Sheet Automator (📄 Cuts)

**What:** Generates per-display spec sheets with product specs, cabinet layout, power/weight/resolution stats, and installation notes. Ready for submittal packages.

**When to use:** Before submitting a proposal. Generate cut sheets for each display.

**Benefit:** One-click submittal-ready spec sheets instead of manual formatting.

---

### 6.10 Lux AI Copilot (💬 Lux)

**What:** Chat with Lux about your estimate in real-time. Lux sees your full estimate data — all displays, costs, margins, bundle items.

**Example questions:**
- "What's the cost breakdown for Display 1?"
- "How can I reduce the total by 15%?"
- "What's the margin on the ribbon boards?"
- "Explain the bundle items for the scoreboard"
- "What if we switch to 6mm instead of 4mm?"

**When to use:** Anytime you need help understanding costs, exploring alternatives, or explaining numbers to a client.

**Benefit:** AI assistant that understands your exact estimate — no copy-pasting needed.

---

<a id="pdf-filter"></a>
## 7. RFP PDF FILTER

**URL:** `/tools/pdf-filter`

### What It Does
Upload a massive RFP PDF (500-2,500 pages). The system scores every page for relevance to LED/AV work, then lets you drag pages between Keep and Discard piles.

### How It Works
1. **Upload PDF** — drag & drop or file picker
2. **Text extraction** — extracts text from every page
3. **AI scoring** — each page scored for relevance using keyword matching + AI classification
4. **Vision analysis** — for drawing pages, uses AI vision to categorize (electrical, structural, architectural, LED-specific)
5. **Triage view** — two columns: Keep (relevant) and Discard (irrelevant)
6. **Drag & drop** — move pages between columns, reorder
7. **Export** — build filtered PDF with only the pages you kept
8. **Metadata extraction** — auto-extracts project name, client, location, deadlines

### Scoring System
- Text pages: keyword matching against LED/AV terminology presets
- Drawing pages: AI vision categorization (electrical, structural, architectural, etc.)
- Confidence scores per page
- Threshold slider to adjust sensitivity

### Key Sections It Looks For
- Section 11 06 60 — Display Schedule (quantities/dimensions)
- Section 11 63 10 — LED Display Systems (technical specs)
- Division 11 — General LED display requirements
- Any mention of: scoreboard, ribbon, fascia, marquee, video board

---

<a id="ai-chat"></a>
## 8. AI CHAT (GLM-5)
