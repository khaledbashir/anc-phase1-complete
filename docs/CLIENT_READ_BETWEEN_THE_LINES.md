# Read Between the Lines — Client Mind-Read & Predicted Moves

**Purpose:** Infer what the client *really* cares about from what she already asked for, then predict 10–20 next moves (or plant them so we're ready when she asks).

---

## The Hit (what actually lands)

She’s not optimizing a workflow. She’s the one whose name is on the thing when it lands in the client’s inbox. When the buyer opens it at 9 p.m. or forwards it to procurement, she doesn’t get to be in the room — the PDF is. So it has to be *flawless*. No “Draft,” no split table on page 2, no “why does this look like a spreadsheet?” That’s why she pushed on page breaks and “more professional” — she’s protecting the moment she can’t control.

She’s also the one who has to fix it when her team is confused. When someone asks “what do I do next?” or “which version did we send?” she’s the backstop. So she asked for Bid Health to make sense and the header to calm down — not because she loves UX, but because she’s tired of being the human FAQ and the one who catches the mistake before it goes out.

Underneath: she wants to be the *reliable* one. The one who doesn’t ship crap, who doesn’t lose a version, who doesn’t make the client wonder if they’re dealing with amateurs. Every ask so far is either “don’t embarrass us in front of the client” or “don’t make me the only person who knows how this works.” The 20 moves are just the list. **The hit is: she’s owning the moment she can’t be in the room for, and the confusion she doesn’t want to own alone.**

## What She Already Asked For (and what it signals)

| She asked for | Between the lines |
|---------------|-------------------|
| PDF page breaks, no split rows | **"What the end client sees has to be perfect."** She sends these to buyers; sloppy PDF = lost trust. |
| Cleaner header, dropdowns, less clutter | **"My team uses this all day."** Cognitive load and speed matter. She doesn’t want people lost in the UI. |
| Bold Premium more professional | **"We need to look premium to win deals."** Presentation = closing. She’s thinking end-client perception. |
| VPS maintenance, zombie procs, Docker cleanup | **"This runs for real."** Ops and stability matter. She owns the system. |
| Bid Health explained + less confusing, weighted, grouped | **"My people get confused."** She wants clarity and *action* (what to fix), not noise. She’s thinking handoff and accountability. |
| Complete feature inventory + proactive suggestions | **"I need to plan and report."** Roadmap, stakeholder updates, or selling the product. She thinks in “what’s done / what’s next.” |

**Inferred client priorities:**  
Professional output → End-client experience → Team not confused → Stability → Clear roadmap and control.

## Predicted / Plant 20 Moves (what she’ll ask for or we pre-suggest)

### End-client experience (she sends these PDFs to *them*)

1. **Client-facing branding** — Logo, primary color, “Prepared for [Client Name]” on every PDF. She’ll want to white-label or at least look like “their” proposal.
2. **One link to send** — “Share” that gives a single link: client opens, sees the proposal (read-only), no login. She’s not going to want “download PDF and email”; she’ll want “send this link.”
3. **Optional client portal** — Client sees proposal, can add comments or “Accept” / “Request changes.” She’ll eventually want a paper trail and less back-and-forth email.
4. **Hide margin / internal view vs client view** — Toggle so client PDF never shows margin or internal notes. She’s already thinking “what they see” vs “what we see.”

### Less rework and handoff (templates, versioning, comparison)

5. **Save as template** — Save current proposal as “School District AV” or “Corporate Lobby” and start new ones from it. She’ll ask for this once she has 2–3 repeat project types.
6. **Version labels** — “Pre-review,” “Sent to client 3/5,” “Final.” She’ll want to know *which* version went out and to whom.
7. **Compare two versions** — Side-by-side or diff view: “What changed between what we sent and what we’re sending now?” Handoff and revision tracking.
8. **Duplicate project** — “Copy this proposal for Rev 2” without losing Rev 1. Natural next step after versioning.

### Clarity and “what to do next” (like Bid Health)

9. **First-time / empty-state guidance** — “You haven’t added screens yet — start here.” She streamlined Bid Health so people aren’t confused; she’ll want the same for new projects.
10. **Checklist or “ready to send” gate** — Simple list: PDF generated? Client name set? Key fields filled? “Not ready” vs “Ready to send.” One place to look.
11. **“What’s missing” nudge** — E.g. “3 screens have no brightness — fix or ignore?” Same philosophy as Bid Health: one clear call to action.

### Speed and consistency (her team’s daily grind)

12. **Smart defaults** — Pre-fill client address from name, or “last used” screen config. She’ll want fewer clicks for repeat work.
13. **Copy/paste screens** — Copy one (or many) screens to same or another project. She’s already thinking “similar jobs.”
14. **Bulk edit screens** — “Set all to 25% margin” or “Update all pitch to 10mm.” She’ll ask once someone does it manually the third time.
15. **Reusable clauses** — Terms, warranty, exclusions as saved snippets; pick “Standard terms” per proposal. Legal consistency and speed.

### Trust and control (she runs this for real)

16. **Audit trail** — Who changed what and when (already has “Audit” in header). She’ll want “who sent what” and “what changed before send.”
17. **Deadline or “due date” on proposal** — So nothing slips. She thinks in projects and dates.
18. **Backup / export project** — One-click “download this project as backup” or “restore from backup.” Peace of mind after we do versioning.

### Scale and roadmap (inventory + suggestions)

19. **Roles or “who can do what”** — Even simple: “Viewer” vs “Editor.” She’ll think about it when a second person touches proposals.
20. **Simple analytics** — “How many proposals this month?” “Which template is used most?” She has inventory and suggestions; she’ll want “how are we using this?”

## How to use this doc

- **Predict:** When she says “we need X,” we’ve already listed it here and can map it to a number (e.g. “that’s #2, one link to send”).
- **Plant:** We can proactively suggest 2–3 of these in the next conversation (e.g. “Given you care about what the client sees, we could add client-facing branding and a single share link”) and add any she approves to `APPROVED_SHIT.md`.
- **Prioritize:** Moves 1–4 and 9–11 are closest to what she’s already asked for (output + clarity); 5–8 are the workflow she said she liked. Start there when she asks “what next?”
