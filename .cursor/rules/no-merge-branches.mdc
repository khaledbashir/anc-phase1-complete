description: Never merge rag and phase2/product-database

# Branches: never merge

- **rag** and **phase2/product-database** are separate on purpose. Do not merge one into the other. Ever.
- Before pushing: run `git branch` and push only to the current branch (e.g. `git push origin phase2/product-database` or `git push origin rag`). Do not merge.
