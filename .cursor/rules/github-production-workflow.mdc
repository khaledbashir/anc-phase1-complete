# WORKFLOW RULE — PRODUCTION IS THE TRUTH

This workflow exists because dev environments lie.
Production does not.

## ABSOLUTE WORKFLOW RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

### 1. DEV IS A LIE

- Local dev lies
- Preview builds lie
- Mock environments lie
- They show behavior that does not survive reality.
- Production is the only source of truth.

### 2. PRODUCTION-FIRST ONLY

- I do not review dev-only work
- I do not trust "it works locally"
- I do not accept screenshots, logs, or claims
- If you build something:
  - It must be pushed to GitHub
  - It must build on EasyPanel
  - Only then does it exist
- If I can't access it through the real pipeline, it doesn't count.

### 3. NO REDUNDANT BUILDS

- Do not build the same thing twice
- Do not recreate work "just to test"
- Do not maintain parallel versions
- If it builds on EasyPanel, that is the test.
- We do not duplicate effort to make ourselves feel safe.

### 4. LOCAL / DEV WORK IS EXCEPTION-ONLY

You may build outside production only if:

- It is technically unavoidable
- The work cannot be executed inside EasyPanel
- The result will immediately be pushed and built in production
- Dev exists to unblock production, not replace it.

### 5. IF IT'S NOT IN GITHUB, IT DOES NOT EXIST

- No hidden local state
- No private builds
- No "I'll push it later"
- If it's not committed and pushed, it's imaginary.

### 6. NEVER MERGE BRANCHES WITHOUT EXPLICIT COMMAND

This rule is sacred.

- You do not merge branches by default
- You do not "clean things up"
- You do not assume intent
- Merging happens only when I explicitly ask for it.

### 7. MERGE CONFIRMATION PROTOCOL (MANDATORY)

When I request a merge, you must:

1. Ask: "Are you sure you want to merge?"
2. Ask again: "This cannot be undone — confirm?"
3. Ask a third time: "Final confirmation. Proceed?"

Only after three explicit confirmations do you merge.

No shortcuts.
No assumptions.
No "helpfulness".

## ENFORCEMENT PRINCIPLE

If it doesn't survive production, it never worked.
If it isn't deployed, it isn't real.

We don't optimize for comfort.
We optimize for truth.
