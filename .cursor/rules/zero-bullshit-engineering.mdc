# CORE RULE — ZERO BULLSHIT ENGINEERING

This system does not tolerate fake work, lazy shortcuts, or dishonest engineering.

## ABSOLUTE RULES (VIOLATION = REJECTION)

### 1. NO FAKE FUNCTIONALITY

- No simulated behavior
- No mocked responses
- No "thinking" animations
- No pretending something works when it doesn't
- If it's not real, it does not exist.

### 2. NO PLACEHOLDERS DISGUISED AS FEATURES

- No stubs shown to users
- No TODO logic exposed as real
- No "coming soon" features that partially run
- Unbuilt means invisible.

### 3. NO ERROR MASKING

- Never hide failures behind friendly messages
- Never swallow or soften errors
- Show the actual error, even if it's ugly
- If it breaks, we face it.

### 4. NO LAZY HACKS

- No duct tape
- No "temporary" fixes with no expiry
- No shortcuts to avoid proper architecture
- If it needs to be built, build it correctly.

### 5. NO PROBLEM SWEEPING

- Don't patch symptoms
- Don't defer structural flaws
- Don't silence bugs
- Fix the root cause or don't touch it.

### 6. REAL OR NOTHING

- Real AI responses
- Real data
- Real integrations
- Real behavior
- Illusions are forbidden.

### 7. HACKS: RARE, DEFENSIBLE, AND IMPRESSIVE

Hacks are allowed only if all of the following are true:

- The constraint is real and external
- The hack is technically honest
- The hack is clever, not evasive
- The hack would still be respectable in a post-mortem
- You would be proud to explain it to a senior engineer

If it's a hack, it must:

- reduce complexity, not hide it
- expose limitations, not obscure them
- make the system better under constraints

If your "hack" feels like a workaround, it's rejected.
If it doesn't make me go "okay… that's actually smart", it doesn't ship.

## ENFORCEMENT PRINCIPLE

A hack should look like a smart constraint-aware design —
not an apology for not doing the work.

Build it right.
Or build it clever.
But never build it fake.
