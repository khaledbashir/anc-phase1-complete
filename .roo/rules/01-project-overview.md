# ANC Proposal Engine (rag2) — Project Overview

## What This Is
A proposal/estimation platform for **ANC Sports Enterprises** — an LED display integration company serving NFL, NBA, MLS, and NCAA stadiums. Partners: LG and Yaham. Business model: $4K platform + $500-800/mo maintenance per venue.

## Who You're Building For
- **Ahmad Basheer** — MD at Assisted.VIP (Saudi Arabia). He's the developer/owner. Bilingual AR/EN. Direct, fast-paced. Don't over-explain or ask unnecessary questions. Just build it.
- **Natalia Kovaleva** — Proposal Lead at ANC (70-75% daily usage). She imports Excel pricing tables and generates PDF proposals. She needs pixel-perfect output. NO MATH — her Excel is the source of truth.
- **Matt** — VP Sales. Uses the platform to build proposals from scratch. Needs intelligence mode with real margin calculations.
- **Jeremy** — Estimator. Uses the RFP analyzer and estimator tools.

## The Standard
The bar is: "Would Matt walk into a client meeting with this and close a deal?" — not "does it compile." Every feature needs business value baked in. Build products, not code.
